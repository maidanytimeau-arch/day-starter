## Conclusion

The AI opportunity for Australian media/technology stocks is significant but unevenly distributed:

1. **Seek** has the largest AI opportunity but also faces the highest disruption risk. AI could make Seek indispensable through superior matching OR AI chatbots could bypass Seek entirely. Seek has the data, the execution capability, and the commitment to AI to emerge as a winner—but this is a high-beta play on AI with significant downside risk.

2. **REA Group** has a strong AI opportunity with lower disruption risk. Property transactions are complex, high-value, and infrequent, making AI a tool rather than a replacement. REA has the data, market position, and financial resources to leverage AI effectively with lower execution risk.

3. **IDP Education** has a medium-high AI opportunity in a complex but attractive market. The company has unique end-to-end data and IELTS co-ownership, but operates in a regulated, culturally complex environment. AI adoption will be gradual but the opportunity is significant if executed well.

4. **Carsales** has a medium AI opportunity. The auto marketplace use case is compelling but lower frequency than property, jobs, or education. Carsales has been slower to invest in AI but has international platforms that could benefit from AI solutions.

**Bottom Line:** Investors seeking AI exposure in Australian media/technology stocks should prioritize **Seek** and **REA Group** as high-conviction picks, with **IDP Education** as an attractive medium-high conviction opportunity and **Carsales** as a medium-conviction holding to watch for execution.
