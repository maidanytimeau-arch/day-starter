## What I Need You To Do 🔥

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project (5 minutes)

**Option A: Quick (Recommended for now)**
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Click "Add project"
3. Name: `littlebites-baby-tracker`
4. Click "Create project"

**That's it!** I'll handle the rest once you tell me the project is created.

### Step 2: Let Me Know

Once the Firebase project is created, just say:
> "Firebase project ready"

I'll then:
- Configure Firebase for Flutter
- Set up Firestore, Auth, and Storage
- Build the app structure
- Start implementing screens

## What Happens After Firebase Setup

**Week 1: Foundation**
- Initialize Firebase in Flutter
- Create core data models (User, Profile, Food, Log, etc.)
- Build app navigation structure
- Implement Firebase Auth
- Set up Riverpod state management

**Week 2: Core Features**
- Build Home screen
- Build Add Meal screen
- Build Food History screen
- Implement meal logging with photos
- Real-time sync testing

**Week 3: Advanced Features**
- Build Log Reaction screen
- Build Poop Log screen
- Build Profiles/Family screen
- Build Settings screen
- Implement offline support
- Beta testing with you and family

- UI/UX designed

**Phase 2: Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETE
- Flutter installed
- Project created
- Dependencies installed
- Data models defined

**Phase 3: Firebase Setup** ⏳ WAITING FOR YOU
- Need Firebase project created
- I'll handle all configuration

**Phase 4: Development** 🚧 NOT STARTED (waiting for Firebase)

## Quick FAQ

**Q: Why do I need to create the Firebase project?**
A: Firebase requires a Google account to create projects. I can configure everything else, but the initial project creation needs your Google account.

**Q: Do I need to configure Firebase myself?**
A: No! Just create the project. I'll handle:
- Enabling Auth, Firestore, Storage
- Security rules
- Firebase configuration in Flutter
- Real-time sync setup

**Q: How long until I can use the app?**
A: Once you create the Firebase project, I'll build the core features. Beta testing in ~2-3 weeks.

**Q: What about the App Store?**
A: That's later. First, we build a working MVP, test it with family, then prepare for App Store submission.
