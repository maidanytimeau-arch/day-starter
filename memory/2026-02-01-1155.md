## Conversation Summary

user: i'd like to set up discord
[message_id: a7928703-0386-4c83-ae9f-389326da45e2]
assistant: I'll help you set up Discord for OpenClaw. Here's what you need to do:

## Step 1: Create a Discord Bot
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application** and give it a name
3. Go to **Bot** → **Add Bot**
4. Copy the **Bot Token** (you'll need this)

## Step 2: Enable Required Intents
In your bot settings under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
- ✅ **Message Content Intent** (required)
- ✅ **Server Members Intent** (recommended for allowlists)

## Step 3: Invite the Bot to Your Server
1. Go to **OAuth2** → **URL Generator**
2. Under **Scopes**, check:
   - ✅ `bot`
   - ✅ `applications.commands`
3. Under **Bot Permissions**, check:
   - ✅ View Channels
   - ✅ Send Messages
   - ✅ Read Message History
   - ✅ Embed Links
   - ✅ Attach Files
4. Copy the URL, open it, and add the bot to your server

## Step 4: Configure OpenClaw

Once you have the bot token, I can help you configure it. Would you like me to:

**Option A: Quick setup (just DMs)**
```json
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B: Server setup with specific channel access**
I'll need:
- Your bot token
- Guild ID (right-click server → Copy Server ID, with Developer Mode enabled)
- Channel ID(s) you want the bot to work in

Paste your bot token when you're ready, and tell me which setup you prefer. I'll take care of the configuration.

assistant: Here's how to find your bot token:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2. Click on your application (if you haven't created one yet, click **New Application** first)

3. In the left sidebar, click **Bot**

4. If you haven't created a bot yet, click **Add Bot**, then click **Yes, do it!**

5. You'll see a **Token** section with a button that says **Reset Token** or **Copy**

6. Click **Copy** to get your bot token

**⚠️ Important:** 
- The bot token is like a password — treat it as secret
- If you share it with me, I'll add it to your config securely
- You can always regenerate it if needed via **Reset Token**

Once you've copied the token, paste it here and I'll set up the configuration for you.

assistant: ❌ Not connected. The bot token is returning **401 Unauthorized**.

This usually means:
- The token is incorrect or expired
- You might have copied a different token (application token vs bot token)

Let's double-check:

1. Go back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click on your application
3. Go to **Bot** on the left sidebar
4. Under the **Token** section, click **Copy** to get a fresh token

Paste the new token here and I'll update the config. Make sure you're copying from the **Bot** section (not the General Information section).
