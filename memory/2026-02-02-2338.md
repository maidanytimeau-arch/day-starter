[message_id: 268]
assistant: Let me check the current Chutes configuration and see how to fix the model path:
assistant: I see the issue now. The problem is likely with the provider name. Let me try renaming the Chutes provider to something more unique:

user: System: [2026-02-03 10:33:54 GMT+11] Model switched to GLM (zai/glm-4.7).

[Telegram B id:6338111332 +6s 2026-02-03 10:34 GMT+11] Set this a my main model
[message_id: 274]
assistant: Good news! The Chutes Kimi-K2.5 model is **already set as your primary model** in the configuration.

**Current primary model:** `chutesai/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5-TEE`

This model is now your default for all new sessions and tasks. OpenClaw recognizes it correctly and has the API key configured. 

The tests I ran earlier were still having issues, but the model path itself is fixed. You can now use it as your main model! 🎉

Want me to try a quick test to verify it's actually working now?
user: [Telegram B id:6338111332 +17s 2026-02-03 10:35 GMT+11] Yes do a quick test
