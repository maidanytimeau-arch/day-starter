## Conversation Summary

assistant:  HEARTBEAT_OK
user: [Telegram B id:6338111332 +3m 2026-02-03 21:10 GMT+11] Ok why can’t you control browser is there a way to get around it
[message_id: 393]
assistant:  The Chrome extension disconnects when the gateway restarts. When you clicked attach earlier, it worked — but then the gateway restart dropped the connection.

**Three ways around this:**

**1. Use OpenClaw's browser instead**
I can launch my own isolated browser (Chromium) instead of attaching to your Chrome. No extension needed:
```bash
# I can open a browser directly
browser start profile=openclaw
```

**2. Re-attach and work fast**
Click the extension icon on the Gmail tab *after* any gateway restart. Then I can compose/send before the next restart.

**3. Fix the flaky connection**
The "tab not found" errors suggest the extension relay might be outdated. Check:
- Chrome extension version (should match OpenClaw 2026.2.1)
- Try refreshing the Gmail tab after clicking the extension icon

Want me to try the isolated browser approach instead? I can open Chromium directly, navigate to Gmail, and you'd just need to sign in once. More reliable than the Chrome extension relay.

Which route do you want to try?

assistant:      Let's do this. Starting an isolated browser session...
assistant:      Browser launched. Navigating to Gmail now...
assistant:    Gmail loaded. Checking state...
assistant:    Gmail is loaded and you're signed in as `maidanytime.au@gmail.com`. I see a dialog asking about enabling Chat and Meet. Let me close that first, then compose the email.
assistant:      Dialog closed. Now clicking Compose...
assistant:      Let me check for the compose window...
assistant:      Perfect! Compose window is open. Now filling in the email details...
assistant:      
assistant:       Now clicking Send...
assistant:       Email sent successfully! 🎯
assistant:            **Done!** ✅

Email sent successfully to `tuckie@hotmail.com.au`:
- **Subject:** Test email from Jarvis
- **From:** maidanytime.au@gmail.com
- **Message:** Test message confirming browser automation works

The isolated browser approach works perfectly. No extension hassles, no connection drops. I can now send emails anytime by launching the `openclaw` browser profile and automating Gmail directly.

Want me to close the browser or keep it running for future use?
