## Conversation Summary

user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +14m 2026-02-04 09:45 GMT+11] Ok cool can we make day starter more robust to include this. Also make sure we keep updating GitHub to ensure our code is backed up

assistant: Let me check out the daystarter setup and understand what needs improving.
assistant: I see what's happening! The rate limit error came from the **job search cron job** (not the daystarter itself). The daystarter already uses RSS feeds which are robust and don't have rate limits.

A couple of things to do:

**1. Commit the current changes to GitHub first:**
assistant: ✅ **Code backed up to GitHub!** 

Now for the daystarter robustness question. The rate limit was actually on the **job search cron job**, not the daystarter itself (the daystarter already uses robust RSS feeds). 

I can do two things:

**1. Make the job search cron job more robust** (handle rate limits gracefully, use alternative sources)
assistant: Done! Here's what I've set up:

✅ **GitHub backup** - Created `/scripts/git-backup.sh` that:
- Auto-commits and pushes changes
- Logs all activity
- Runs manually (can add to cron later)

**Question on daystarter:** The rate limit was on the **job search cron job**, not the daystarter. When you say "make day starter more robust to include this," do you want:

1. **Add job search results to the daystarter briefing?** (So it includes Jessica's job listings in the morning briefing)

2. **Fix the job search cron job** to handle rate limits better? (Use rate-limit-safe APIs, fallback sources, retry logic)

3. **Make daystarter handle all errors gracefully?** (Better timeout handling, fallback options)

Which one, or something else?
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +2m 2026-02-04 09:50 GMT+11] Oh not rate limit it was weather being unavailable in day starter
[message_id: 1468378251108942052]
assistant: Got it! You want the daystarter to handle weather failures more gracefully (even though it's working now, make it more resilient if it goes down again).

Let me update the daystarter to be more robust:
assistant: ✅ **Done! Here's what I've improved:**

## Daystarter Robustness Updates

**Weather (3 fallback sources now):**
1. **Primary:** wttr.in (full format with temp, wind, conditions)
2. **Fallback 1:** wttr.in (simple format)  
3. **Fallback 2:** Open-Meteo API (completely independent service)
4. **Error messages** now show WHICH service failed if all fail

**News:**
- Better error tracking for each RSS feed
- Shows which feed failed if nothing loads
- Still has Hacker News as backup

**Calendar & Reminders:**
- Improved timeout handling (8s instead of 5s)
- Graceful failure if services are down
- Better exception handling

## GitHub Backup

**Created `/scripts/git-backup.sh`:**
- Auto-commits and pushes changes
- Logs all activity to `scripts/git-backup.log`
- Can be run manually or added to cron later

**Already pushed everything to GitHub** ✅

**Next step:** Want me to set up an automatic git backup cron job (e.g., every 6 hours), or are you happy running it manually when needed?
