assistant: Hey Bob. 🤖 Ready to help — what's on your plate today?
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +25s 2026-02-05 06:45 GMT+11] Our activity stream is broken and not posting anything
[message_id: 1468693898283974756]
assistant: Let me check the activity stream services and see what's going on.
assistant: Both services are online. Let me check the logs for errors:
assistant: Found it — the parser is posting to `/webhook` but getting a 404. Let me check the parser configuration:
assistant: The parser code shows it should use `/webhook/activity`, but the logs say it's using `/webhook`. There must be an env variable overriding it. Let me check:
assistant: Let me check the PM2 configuration for the parser:
assistant: I notice PM2 is running `parser.js` not `parser-claw.js`. Let me check that file:
assistant: Found it! `parser.js` has the wrong webhook URL. It's using `/webhook` instead of `/webhook/activity`. Let me also verify the bot endpoint:
assistant: Confirmed — the bot listens on `/webhook/activity` but parser is posting to `/webhook`. Fixing it now:
assistant: Fixed! The webhook URL is now correct. Let me wait a moment to see if there's any new activity:
assistant: The bot is running and listening. Let me trigger some activity to test it works now:
assistant: Fixed! The issue was a mismatch between the parser's webhook URL (`/webhook`) and the bot's endpoint (`/webhook/activity`).

**What I did:**
1. Updated `parser.js` to use the correct endpoint: `/webhook/activity`
2. Restarted the parser service via PM2
3. Verified no more 404 errors

**Current status:**
- ✅ `claw-activity-stream` - Online (7h uptime)
- ✅ `claw-activity-parser` - Online (just restarted)
- ✅ Webhook URL: `http://localhost:3000/webhook/activity`

The stream should work now — new activity will post to your Discord channel. The parser watches the log in real-time, so it won't replay old entries, just new ones going forward.
user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
