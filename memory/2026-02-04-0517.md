[message_id: 1468466546404753494]
assistant: Thanks, Bob. 🤖
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +9m 2026-02-04 15:51 GMT+11] Ok how do we better leverage subagents. Also we have access to chutesai but with limited tokens how we better leverage having multiple AI apis etc
[message_id: 1468468891410763838]
assistant: Great question! Let me break down how to better leverage both subagents and multiple AI APIs.

## Current Situation

**You have access to:**
- **Chutes.AI** (multiple models): Kimi-K2.5, DS-V3, DS-R1, Qwen3
- **Token limits:** Limited on Chutes.AI
- **Current default:** Kimi-K2.5 (balanced, but expensive)

## Better Subagent Strategy

### 1. **Task-Based Model Selection**

Different models excel at different things. Use them strategically:

```
Quick Research (web search, simple queries)
  → DS-V3 (fast, cheaper)

Complex Reasoning (planning, analysis)
  → DS-R1 or Kimi-K2.5 (best thinking)

Coding (write scripts, debug)
  → DS-R1 or Qwen3 (strong reasoning + code gen)

Summarization (process logs, condense)
  → DS-V3 or Kimi-K2 (good at summarization)
```

### 2. **Parallel Subagents**

Spawn subagents when you have independent tasks - don't do them sequentially:

```
Main Agent (Kimi-K2.5 - orchestrator)
    ↓ spawns
    ├─ Subagent A: Research stock X (DS-V3 - fast)
    ├─ Subagent B: Summarize logs (DS-V3 - cheap)
    ├─ Subagent C: Write Python script (DS-R1 - coding)
    └─ Subagent D: Analyze data (Qwen3 - general purpose)

All run in parallel, report back when done
```

**When to use:**
- Multiple stocks to research
- Multiple files to process
- Independent web searches
- Separate analyses needed

### 3. **Cost-Effective Workflow**

```
Main session: Light orchestration (cheap model)
  → Delegates heavy lifting to subagents

Subagents: Do the actual work (specialized models)
  → Use cheapest model that gets job done

Result: Main session saves expensive tokens
```

## Multiple AI API Strategy

### 1. **Model Use Hierarchy**

```
Tier 1 (Free/Unlimited): Use when possible
  - Built-in tools (web_search, exec, file ops)
  - Local capabilities

Tier 2 (Cheap): DS-V3
  - Quick tasks, bulk processing
  - Web searches, simple queries

Tier 3 (Balanced): Kimi-K2.5
  - Main session orchestration
  - Complex decisions, user-facing responses

Tier 4 (Premium): DS-R1, Qwen3
  - Only when quality matters more than cost
  - Coding, complex reasoning, critical tasks
```

### 2. **Smart Routing (Future Enhancement)**

Could build a model router that:
- Analyzes task type
- Routes to optimal model
- Falls back if rate limited
- Tracks token usage per provider

```python
# Pseudo-code example
def route_task(task):
    if task.is_simple_query():
        return "DS-V3"
    elif task.requires_coding():
        return "DS-R1"
    elif task.is_reasoning_heavy():
        return "Kimi-K2.5"
    else:
        return "Qwen3"
```

### 3. **Current Actions You Can Take**

**Right now - no code changes needed:**

1. **Explicit model selection in prompts:**
   ```
   "Use DS-V3 for this quick web search"
   "Spawn a subagent with DS-R1 for coding task"
   ```

2. **Parallel subagent spawning:**
   ```
   "Research these 5 stocks in parallel subagents"
   ```

3. **Tiered tasks:**
   ```
   "I'll do light planning here, then spawn subagents for heavy lifting"
   ```

**Medium-term - add to agents_list or config:**
- Create model aliases for task types
- Add token usage tracking
- Configure fallback providers

**Would you like me to:**
1. Create a model routing guide (when to use which model)?
2. Build a simple cost tracker script?
3. Demo parallel subagents on a real task?

What's your priority - saving tokens or getting better results?
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +5m 2026-02-04 15:57 GMT+11] Btw I also have access to zai which is essentially unlimited glm4.7 model
[message_id: 1468470428572844063]
assistant: Ah! **UNLIMITED GLM-4.7** changes everything. That's your workhorse. 🚀

## Updated Strategy (With zai Unlimited)

### Primary Workhorse: GLM-4.7 (zai)

**Use this for 90% of tasks:**
- Main session orchestration
- Complex reasoning
- Research and analysis
- Coding and debugging
- Long conversations
- Anything token-intensive

**Why:** Unlimited tokens = no cost anxiety. Use it freely.

---

### When to Use Chutes.AI Models

**DS-V3 (Cheap):**
- Ultra-fast web searches (when speed > quality)
- Bulk simple processing
- Quick summarization

**DS-R1 (Premium):**
- When you need DeepSeek R1's specific reasoning style
- If GLM-4.7 is struggling with a specific task
- Experimental comparisons

**Qwen3:**
- Qwen-specific capabilities needed
- Fallback if GLM-4.7 has issues

**Kimi-K2.5:**
- Rare - only if Kimi-specific features are needed

---

### Subagent Strategy (Unlimited GLM Makes This Better)

**Pattern: Main + Parallel Workers**

```
Main Session (GLM-4.7 - orchestrator)
    ↓ spawns parallel
    ├─ Subagent A (GLM-4.7): Research stock X
    ├─ Subagent B (GLM-4.7): Analyze logs Y
    ├─ Subagent C (GLM-4.7): Write script Z
    └─ Subagent D (GLM-4.7): Summarize findings

All report back
    ↓
Main (GLM-4.7): Synthesize and respond
```

**Key insight:** With unlimited tokens, subagents become free. Spawn as many as needed - no cost penalty.

---

### Concrete Examples

**Task:** "Research and analyze 5 ASX stocks"

```
❌ Old way (sequential, cost-conscious):
   Main: Stock 1...done
   Main: Stock 2...done
   Main: Stock 3...done
   Main: Stock 4...done
   Main: Stock 5...done
   Total: 1 expensive session

✅ New way (parallel, unlimited):
   Main: Spawn 5 subagents in parallel
   ↓
   Subagent 1: Stock 1 report (GLM-4.7)
   Subagent 2: Stock 2 report (GLM-4.7)
   Subagent 3: Stock 3 report (GLM-4.7)
   Subagent 4: Stock 4 report (GLM-4.7)
   Subagent 5: Stock 5 report (GLM-4.7)
   ↓
   Main: Synthesize all reports (GLM-4.7)
   Total: Fast, comprehensive, cost-free
```

**Task:** "Debug and fix 3 scripts"

```
Main: Spawn 3 subagents in parallel
  ├─ Subagent A: Debug script 1 (GLM-4.7)
  ├─ Subagent B: Debug script 2 (GLM-4.7)
  └─ Subagent C: Debug script 3 (GLM-4.7)
Main: Consolidate fixes and verify (GLM-4.7)
```

---

### Immediate Actions You Can Take

**1. Update default model:**
```bash
# Make GLM-4.7 your default everywhere
# Check your agent config
```

**2. Try parallel subagents now:**
```
Me: "I'll spawn 3 subagents in parallel to research X, Y, Z"
```

**3. Stop worrying about tokens:**
GLM-4.7 is unlimited. Think big tasks, not "token-efficient" tasks.

user: System: [2026-02-04 16:00:00 GMT+11] 📰 NEWS ALERT: Check for breaking news on 17 ASX coverage stocks (LIF, ABB, CAR, IEL, MP1, NWS, NXT, REA, SEK, SLC, TLS, TNE, TPG, WTC, XRO, XYZ, ZIP). Only alert if significant news (earnings, M&A, guidance changes, management changes, regulatory issues). Send to Discord if found.

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +4m 2026-02-04 16:05 GMT+11] Ok I like kimi-2.5 for deeper thinking
[message_id: 1468472550060327003]
assistant: Done! Updated MEMORY.md with your model preference:

**Added Model Selection Guide:**
- **Kimi-K2.5** for deep thinking and complex reasoning (your preference ✅)
- **GLM-4.7** as primary workhorse (90% of tasks, unlimited)
- **DS-V3** for fast/cheap tasks
- **DS-R1/Qwen3** for specialized coding

Pushed to GitHub. Your preference is now recorded for future sessions.
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +1m 2026-02-04 16:08 GMT+11] Ok great so when I ask you to help me do something will you route the task to the different models?
[message_id: 1468473269194723504]
assistant: **Short answer:** Yes, I'll proactively route to the best model for each task and explain why.

**Here's how it will work:**

```
You ask: "Research these 5 stocks"
    ↓
I route: "I'll use DS-V3 for fast parallel searches..."
    ↓
I do: Spawns 5 DS-V3 subagents, then synthesizes
```

**If you want to override:**
```
You: "Use Kimi-K2.5 for this analysis"
I: "Switching to Kimi-K2.5 for deep reasoning..."
```

**When I'll use each model (from MEMORY.md):**

| Model | When I'll use |
|--------|----------------|
| **GLM-4.7** | 90% of tasks (unlimited, no cost) |
| **Kimi-K2.5** | Deep thinking, complex reasoning, long analysis (your preference!) |
| **DS-V3** | Quick web searches, bulk simple processing |
| **DS-R1 / Qwen3** | Coding, specific capabilities needed |

**I'll explain my choice:** "Using DS-V3 for fast web search" or "Switching to Kimi-K2.5 for deep analysis"

**Control:**
- Default: I choose best model
- Override: Tell me "Use [model]" and I'll respect it

Want me to add this routing behavior explicitly to MEMORY.md?
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +1m 2026-02-04 16:10 GMT+11] Yes you can remove all other models just use zai and kimi-k2.5
[message_id: 1468473748410728459]
assistant: Done! ✅

**Simplified model strategy - only 2 models now:**

| Model | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| **GLM-4.7** (zai unlimited) | 90% of all tasks - no cost concern |
| **Kimi-K2.5** (chutesai) | Deep thinking & complex reasoning - your preference |

**Removed:** DS-V3, DS-R1, Qwen3, Kimi-K2 (reduces complexity)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simple choices (no confusion about which model to use)
- ✅ GLM-4.7 is unlimited - can spawn unlimited parallel subagents
- ✅ Kimi-K2.5 when you need deep thinking
- ✅ Pushed all changes to GitHub

**Subagent strategy updated:**
Main session spawns parallel GLM-4.7 workers → fast results, no cost penalty

Ready to go! 🚀
