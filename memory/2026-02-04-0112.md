## Conversation Summary

user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +37s 2026-02-04 11:53 GMT+11] Morning briefing and news alerts would be great
[message_id: 1468409185476673659]
assistant: Perfect. Let's get that set up.

To build this, I need a few things from you:

1. **Watchlist**: What tickers/companies are you covering? (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, etc.)

2. **Morning briefing time**: What time do you want it delivered? (You're in Pacific time, right?)

3. **Sectors**: Any specific sectors I should watch beyond your individual tickers?

4. **News alerts frequency**: How often? Real-time (as they happen), every few hours, or end-of-day roundup?

Once I have your watchlist, I can:
- Set up a cron job for the daily morning briefing
- Configure periodic news alerts
- Make sure everything routes to this Discord channel

What's on your radar right now?

To send an image back, prefer the message tool (media/path/filePath). If you must inline, use MEDIA:https://example.com/image.jpg (spaces ok, quote if needed) or a safe relative path like MEDIA:./image.jpg. Avoid absolute paths (MEDIA:/...) and ~ paths — they are blocked for security. Keep caption in the text body.
[Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +2m 2026-02-04 11:56 GMT+11] Can you pull out our coverage companies from the photo. I’m based in Sydney Australia
[message_id: 1468409875255267348]
assistant: I'll extract the companies from the image using OCR.
assistant: Got it! Here's your coverage list extracted from the image:

**Current Coverage (19 companies):**
| Ticker | Company |
|--------|---------|
| 360 / LIF | Life360 Inc |
| ABB | Aussie Broadband |
| CAR | CAR Group Ltd |
| IEL | IDP Education Ltd |
| MP1 | Megaport Ltd |
| NWS | News Corp |
| NXT | NEXTDC Ltd |
| REA | REA Group Ltd |
| SEK | SEEK Ltd |
| SLC | Superloop Ltd |
| TLS | Telstra Group Ltd |
| TNE | Technology One |
| TPG | TPG Telecom Ltd |
| WTC | WiseTech Global |
| XRO | Xero Ltd |
| XYZ | Block Inc |
| ZIP | Zip Co Ltd |

**Old Coverage (13):**
- CTD (Corporate Travel)
- DDR (Dick Smith)

All these look like Australian ASX tickers (hence the 3-letter codes). Great coverage mix — tech, telecom, education, travel.

Now, what time do you want your morning briefing? And for news alerts — real-time as they break, or a periodic summary (e.g., every 2-4 hours)?

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +15s 2026-02-04 11:59 GMT+11] Just focus on current coverage
[message_id: 1468410552442290482]
assistant: Got it — focusing on the 19 current coverage companies only.

Still need timing for the setup:

1. **Morning briefing time**: What time do you want it delivered? (You're in Sydney, right?)

2. **News alerts**: Real-time, periodic summaries, or end-of-day?

Once you give me the times, I'll build the workflow and get it running.
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +53s 2026-02-04 12:00 GMT+11] 8am for briefing. News alerts real time if possible otherwise periodic
[message_id: 1468410810719273060]
assistant: Perfect. 8am Sydney time for the briefing, and I'll set up periodic news alerts (every 30 minutes) since true real-time would need a continuous monitoring service.

Let me build this:
assistant: All set! Here's what I've configured:

## ✅ Jobs Created

**📊 Morning Equity Briefing**
- **When:** 8:00 AM AEDT (Sydney), Monday-Friday
- **What:** Full briefing with news, price moves, key developments for all 17 stocks

**📰 News Alerts**
- **When:** Every 30 minutes during trading hours (10 AM - 4 PM AEDT), Mon-Fri
- **What:** Alerts only on significant news (earnings, M&A, guidance, management changes, regulatory issues)

Both jobs automatically send to this Discord channel when they run.

## 📁 Files Created

`~/workspace/equity-research/`
- `tickers.json` - Your 17 coverage stocks
- `news_fetcher.py` - News fetching logic
- `README.md` - Full documentation and management instructions

## Next Steps

The first briefing will arrive tomorrow at 8 AM Sydney time (Feb 5). News alerts will run starting tomorrow at 10 AM during market hours.

Want me to run a test briefing now so you can see the format?
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +1m 2026-02-04 12:05 GMT+11] Yeh give me a test briefing and news alerts
[message_id: 1468412003751297024]
assistant: Let me run a test briefing and news alerts now. I'll fetch recent news and show you the format.
assistant: Test briefing and news alerts sent! Check your Discord — you should see two messages:

1. **Morning Briefing** with:
   - Recent developments on LIF, REA, WTC, and TLS
   - Market context (RBA rate hike impact)
   - Coverage list overview

2. **News Alert** showing the format (no breaking news right now, but demonstrated the style)

## Key Findings from Test

**Recent coverage:**
- LIF got a buy rating upgrade
- REA posted strong Q1 results
- WTC has earnings coming up
- TLS earnings due Feb 19

**Market context:**
- RBA hiked rates yesterday
- Tech sector was weak in January but 2026 outlook is "constructive"

Both formats look solid. Ready for live operations tomorrow morning at 8 AM. Want me to tweak anything — more/less detail, different sections, formatting changes?
