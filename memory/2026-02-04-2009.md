assistant: Good morning, Bob. Ready to tackle whatever's on your plate — what would you like to do today?
user: System: [2026-02-05 07:03:04 GMT+11] Model switched to Kimi-K2.5 (chutesai/moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5-TEE).

[Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +34s 2026-02-05 07:04 GMT+11] Ok something is wrong with activity stream it’s not posting anything to discord.
[message_id: 1468698629769265379]
assistant: Let me check the current logs:
assistant: Found it! The parser is getting **HTTP 401 Unauthorized**. The bot expects a webhook secret header that the parser isn't sending. Let me fix the parser:
assistant: Found the problem - the parser isn't sending the webhook secret header. Fixing it:
assistant: Found another issue - the parser is wrapping the payload in extra layers (`type: 'activity'`, `formatted`, etc.) but the bot expects a simple structure. Let me fix that:
assistant: Fixed! Three issues were causing the activity stream to fail:

**What was broken:**
1. ❌ Parser wasn't sending the webhook secret header
2. ❌ Parser was wrapping payloads in extra layers that the bot didn't understand
3. ❌ Parser wasn't configured with the webhook secret

**What I fixed:**
1. ✅ Added `WEBHOOK_SECRET` to parser config
2. ✅ Added `X-Webhook-Secret` header to all requests
3. ✅ Simplified payload structure to match bot's expectations

**Services:**
- `claw-activity-stream` - Bot running (port 3000)
- `claw-activity-parser` - Parser restarted at 07:05:12

The stream should work now — as new OpenClaw activity happens, it'll post to your Discord channel. I manually tested the webhook endpoint and it's responding correctly.
assistant:  I'll check the activity stream. Let me see what's happening with the PM2 services and logs.
assistant:  I see the issue — PM2 is running `parser-claw.js` but we fixed and switched to `parser.js`. The manual webhook test worked (got HTTP 200), so the bot is fine. The parser just isn't sending.
assistant:   Let me check the parser logs and test if it's actually parsing:
assistant:  The parser is sending data (I see successful sends at 07:06), but let me check if the bot is receiving and posting to Discord:
