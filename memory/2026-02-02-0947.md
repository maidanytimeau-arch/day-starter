## Conversation Summary

user: ok try now
[message_id: 06bcec24-d5ac-4a1c-92ba-a2762db67a4f]
assistant: Still need you to **attach the Chrome extension**:

1. Open Chrome
2. Go to any tab
3. **Click the OpenClaw extension icon** in your Chrome toolbar
4. Wait for the badge to turn **ON** (green)

Once the badge is green, I'll be able to control Chrome.
user: ok it is on but badge showing red
[message_id: 4f19ce16-6759-4673-81f2-51a6e6a20ee5]
assistant: The **red** badge means the extension is running but not attached.

**To attach it:**

1. Click the **OpenClaw extension icon** in your Chrome toolbar
2. This should attach the current tab to the gateway
3. The badge should turn **green** (ON) when attached

If clicking doesn't work:
- Make sure the OpenClaw gateway is running (you just restarted it)
- Try refreshing the page and clicking the extension icon again

Give it a try and let me know if the badge turns green!

What would you like me to do in Chrome?
user: can you open a new chrome tab with gmail
[message_id: 0c6f4531-3a58-4c09-a608-c95c67d1809f]
assistant: ✅ Gmail opened in a new tab!

**Tab ID:** `22EF9003638E94DE20E4C7212C0747B4`

Ready to use Gmail. Would you like me to do anything specific with it?
user: can you update the list of models
[message_id: 8713379d-1930-4e0e-adbd-961e99649ba1]
assistant: Do you have an OpenRouter API key now? If so, I can run the scan to update the model list.

If not, you'll need to:

1. Get an API key from [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Set it:
   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. Then I'll run:
   ```bash
   openclaw models scan
   ```

Let me know if you have the key ready!
user: i want to update the list of opencode models
[message_id: 42e9bb4a-9e0b-4e8c-ae89-8aebd38de424]
assistant: Your current setup only has **1 model configured**: `zai/glm-4.7`

To update/add more models, you have a few options:

**1. Scan OpenRouter free models** (requires API key):
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key
openclaw models scan
```

**2. Add a new provider** (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.):
```bash
openclaw models auth add
```
This runs an interactive setup for providers.

**3. Set a new default model manually**:
```bash
openclaw models set <provider/model>
```

---

**What did you mean by "opencode"?** 
- **OpenRouter** (for scanning free models)?
- **OpenAI** (GPT models)?
- Something else?

Let me know and I'll help you set it up!
user: openclaw models auth add
[message_id: 953371a0-1b58-41ae-bb14-2cbe7a3a9fef]
assistant: The auth helper is running. It's asking you to choose a **token provider**:

```
◆  Token provider
│  ● anthropic
│  ○ custom (type provider id)
└
```

**Current options:**
- **anthropic** (for Claude models)
- **custom** (type any provider id manually)

**Which provider do you want to add?**
- `anthropic` — For Claude models (Claude 3, etc.)
- `openai` — For GPT models (GPT-4, etc.)
- `openrouter` — For OpenRouter
- Or type a custom provider ID

Let me know which one and I'll continue the setup!
