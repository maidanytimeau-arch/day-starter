## Day Starter Application

Created a CLI daily dashboard application for Bob called "Day Starter" that consolidates multiple daily view items into one command.

### Features
- Weather (via wttr.in API) - set to Sydney, Australia
- Calendar events - using macOS Calendar integration (syncs with Google Calendar via Internet Accounts)
- Reminders - via Apple Reminders using remindctl CLI
- Overnight news - pulls from NewsAPI.org for comprehensive financial/TMT coverage, with Hacker News fallback
- Daily planning notes - auto-generated markdown files in ~/Documents/DayStarters/

### Technical Details

**Weather**: Uses curl to fetch from wttr.in with Sydney location.

**Calendar**: Uses AppleScript (osascript) to query macOS Calendar app directly. No gcalcli needed - the built-in Calendar app syncs with Google Calendar through macOS Internet Accounts.

**Reminders**: Uses remindctl CLI installed via Homebrew.

**News**: Primary source is NewsAPI.org with Bob's API key (5c2c34de0cdd48ee969ad3c693378c0d). Fetches from business and technology categories, filtered for TMT/finance keywords. Fallback to Hacker News if API fails.

**Notes**: Creates daily markdown files with template for top 3 priorities, notes, and one thing to remember.

### Installation
```bash
brew install remindctl
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/bclawd/.openclaw/workspace/day-starter"
```

### Usage
```bash
daystarter
```

### Location
- Script: `/Users/bclawd/.openclaw/workspace/day-starter/daystarter.py`
- Wrapper: `/Users/bclawd/.openclaw/workspace/day-starter/daystarter`
- Config: `/Users/bclawd/.openclaw/workspace/day-starter/config.py`
- Notes: `~/Documents/DayStarters/`
- Kanban Board: `/Users/bclawd/.openclaw/workspace/KANBAN.md`

### Key Learnings
- AppleScript can query macOS Calendar without needing Google OAuth setup
- wttr.in provides free weather API without authentication
- Hacker News API is open and doesn't require keys
- macOS Calendar automatically syncs with Google Calendar when configured in System Settings → Internet Accounts
- NewsAPI.org provides comprehensive financial news from major sources (WSJ, Bloomberg, BBC, etc.)

### Bob's Preferences
- Located in Sydney, Australia (timezone and weather)
- Interested in finance/tech/telco news from US/UK markets
- Prefers streamlined setup without complex OAuth flows
- Wants quick, actionable daily overview
- Likes transparency - created kanban board to track Jarvis's work for him
- Wants visual dashboard to see project progress and activity logs

### Jarvis Dashboard
- Created visual HTML dashboard for viewing kanban board
- Pulls data from KANBAN.md and memory files
- Shows quick stats, kanban board, active projects, and activity log
- Auto-refreshes every 5 minutes
- Opens in browser automatically
- Location: `~/.openclaw/workspace/DASHBOARD.html`
- Command: `dashboard`
- Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/maidanytimeau-arch/day-starter

## Adding Stock Price Summary

Started working on adding stock price summary to Day Starter.

### Plan
- Use free stock price API (Yahoo Finance or similar)
- Add major tech/TMT stocks: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Nvidia, Verizon, AT&T, Vodafone
- Show daily change percentage
- Display in Day Starter before news section
