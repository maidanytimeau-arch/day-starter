## Model Preferences

**Bob's preference noted:**
- "I like kimi-2.5 for deeper thinking"

**Model selection strategy updated:**
- Kimi-K2.5: Deep thinking, complex reasoning, long-form analysis
- GLM-4.7 (zai unlimited): Primary workhorse, 90% of tasks
- DS-V3: Fast/cheap, quick web searches, bulk processing
- DS-R1 / Qwen3: Specialized coding, specific capabilities

## AI Resource Strategy Summary (Simplified)

**Key insights:**
- GLM-4.7 is unlimited - can use freely without token concerns
- Subagents become cost-effective with unlimited main model
- Parallel subagents = fast results, no penalty
- Removed all other models (DS-V3, DS-R1, Qwen3, Kimi-K2) - reduces complexity

**Updated model strategy:**
- GLM-4.7 (zai): Primary workhorse - 90% of all tasks
- Kimi-K2.5 (chutesai): Deep thinking and complex reasoning - Bob's preference

**Updated MEMORY.md with:**
- Simplified model strategy (only 2 models now)
- Added subagent strategy section with parallel workers
- Pushed to GitHub

**When to use each model:**
- GLM-4.7: 90% of tasks (unlimited tokens)
- Kimi-K2.5: Deep thinking, complex reasoning (Bob's preference)
