assistant:    Still seeing network errors even after restart. Let me check if there's a broader connectivity issue:
assistant:     The test is hanging — confirmed **network-level blocking** of Telegram's API. Let me verify it's specific to Telegram:
assistant:    **Confirmed — Telegram is blocked on your network.**

- ✅ Google works (200)
- ❌ Telegram API times out

This explains why:
- Messages you send to Telegram **don't reach the gateway**
- The gateway shows "network errors" for `getUpdates`
- No Telegram session appears in session list

**Possible causes:**
1. **Corporate/VPN firewall** blocking `api.telegram.org`
2. **ISP/location restrictions** on Telegram
3. **DNS resolution failure** for Telegram domains

**Quick checks:**

1. Are you on a **VPN** or **corporate network** that might block Telegram?
2. Can you access `https://api.telegram.org` from your browser on this machine?
3. Is this a new issue (was Telegram working from this machine before)?

**Potential fixes:**
- Switch networks (mobile hotspot to test)
- Configure a **proxy** in OpenClaw's Telegram settings
- Check if a system VPN is interfering

Want me to help configure a proxy, or can you try a different network first?

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
user: [Discord tuckietuck user id:125865569374175232 +1m 2026-02-04 07:28 GMT+11] Ok it was literally working 10 mins ago and the bot was working on fixing the day starter job, specifically the news fetch that was disabled

**That's strange** — if it was working 10 mins ago, something changed. Let me check if the day-starter work left something in a broken state.
assistant:   No stuck processes. Let me try Telegram API again now that a couple minutes have passed:
assistant:    Still timing out. Let me check what the day-starter script does and if it modified anything:
assistant:     **DNS resolves but TCP connection hangs** — this is a network-level block. Let me check the gateway logs since the restart to see if Telegram reconnected:
assistant:      The gateway restarted and Telegram tried to start at `20:24:40`, but failed immediately with network errors. No Telegram activity since.

**Here's what's happening:**
- DNS resolves `api.telegram.org` → `149.154.166.110`
- But **TCP connection to port 443 times out** — network-level block
- This started sometime between "10 mins ago" and now

**Quick questions to narrow this down:**

1. **Did you change networks recently?** (switch WiFi, turn on VPN, connect to hotspot?)

2. **Check your VPN status** — some corporate VPNs block Telegram:
   ```bash
   scutil --nc list | grep Connected
   ```

3. **Did macOS update or change firewall settings?** Check System Settings → Network → Firewall

4. **Try from your phone** — send a Telegram message via mobile data (not WiFi) to test if it's account-level or network-level

The fact that Discord works fine but Telegram specifically doesn't suggests either:
- VPN/corporate policy blocking Telegram domains
- Router/ISP-level filtering
- Geographic restriction (though unlikely in Australia)

Can you check if you're on a VPN or try the mobile data test?
