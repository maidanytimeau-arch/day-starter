## Conversation Summary

assistant: HEARTBEAT_OK
user: [Telegram B id:6338111332 +28m 2026-02-03 20:01 GMT+11] On chutes website they say you can use the following to directly call the model. How do we use it in Openclaw? curl -X POST \ https://llm.chutes.ai/v1/chat/completions \ -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHUTES_API_TOKEN" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d ' { "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5-TEE", "messages": [ { "role": "user", "content": "Tell me a 250 word story." } ], "stream": true, "max_tokens": 1024, "temperature": 0.7 }'

assistant: Found it! The issue is the `baseUrl`. You need `https://llm.chutes.ai/v1` (not `https://api.chutes.ai/v1`).

Let me fix that:
assistant: Config updated with the correct base URL! Gateway restarted. Let me test Kimi now:
assistant: **It works!** 🎉

Kimi-K2.5 is now functional! The model responded:
> 👋 Hello! Nice to see you!

The fix was changing the `baseUrl` from `https://api.chutes.ai/v1` to `https://llm.chutes.ai/v1`.

**Your setup now includes:**
- ✅ DeepSeek V3 & R1 TEE
- ✅ Kimi K2 & K2.5 TEE
- ✅ Qwen3 235B TEE

You can now switch models using aliases like `Kimi-K2.5`, `DS-V3`, etc.

Ready to use any of these whenever you need them!

A background task "Say hello! Keep it brief." just completed successfully.

Findings:
👋 Hello! Nice to see you!

Stats: runtime 5s • tokens 6.4k (in 4.4k / out 30) • est $0.0000 • sessionKey agent:main:subagent:244a6bf3-1327-403a-9d59-d31c7fa16faf • sessionId dc04fd7a-d754-44e0-9c04-1e4ff9b53c65 • transcript /Users/bclawd/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/dc04fd7a-d754-44e0-9c04-1e4ff9b53c65.jsonl

Summarize this naturally for the user. Keep it brief (1-2 sentences). Flow it into the conversation naturally.
Do not mention technical details like tokens, stats, or that this was a background task.
You can respond with NO_REPLY if no announcement is needed (e.g., internal task with no user-facing result).
assistant: Kimi-K2.5 is working and just said hello! The chutesai provider is now fully configured with all your models ready to go.

user: [Telegram B id:6338111332 +14s 2026-02-03 20:05 GMT+11] What’s the best way to find jobs
[message_id: 342]
assistant:  The best approach depends on your field, but here are the most effective strategies:

**Direct outreach**
- Apply directly on company career pages (often faster than job boards)
- Reach out to hiring managers or team leads on LinkedIn with a specific, concise message
- Ask for referrals from your network — they skip the resume pile

**Job platforms**
- **LinkedIn** — set up job alerts, use Easy Apply sparingly, focus on connections
- **Indeed/Seek** — good for volume, but competition is high
- **AngelList/Wellfound** — best for startups
- **Industry-specific boards** — e.g., Hacker News "Who is Hiring" for tech

**Network-driven**
- Attend meetups, conferences, or local events in your industry
- Join Slack/Discord communities for your field
- Let people know you're looking — most jobs aren't posted publicly

**Make yourself findable**
- Optimize your LinkedIn with keywords recruiters search for
- Build a simple portfolio or GitHub presence if relevant
- Publish or share work in your field

**The 80/20:** Spend 80% of your effort on tailored applications and direct outreach to companies you actually want to work for, not mass-applying to everything.

What field are you in? I can give more specific advice.
user: [Telegram B id:6338111332 +31s 2026-02-03 20:06 GMT+11] With kimi-k2.5 in Openclaw what level of thinking is best? What do people on reddit or the internet say
[message_id: 346]
assistant:  Based on Reddit and general consensus:

**For Kimi-K2.5 specifically:**

- **Thinking ON** — Best for complex reasoning, coding, analysis. It "feels like GPT-5.2" in benchmarks and handles deep reasoning exceptionally well.

- **Thinking OFF** — Best for chat, creative writing, and general tasks. The model is already very capable without visible reasoning, and it responds faster and more concisely.

**What people recommend:**
- Keep thinking **off by default** for most tasks (faster, cleaner responses)
- Turn it **on for hard problems** (code debugging, complex logic, multi-step planning)

**In OpenClaw:**
You can toggle reasoning with `/reasoning` or set it per task. The `Kimi-K2.5-TEE` model you configured has reasoning enabled, but OpenClaw lets you control the visibility.

Want me to toggle reasoning on or show you how to control it?
